Django Registration App by POPVOX
=================================

This app provides infrastructure for new user registration including support
for social logins (built-in support for Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook).
For new user accounts using an email address and password, the user is sent a
confirmation (verification) email *before* the account is created.

The email verification routine can be used as an independent app that provides
an infrastructure for executing callback routines when a user follows a custom
link sent to them in an email. See emailverification/README.txt for details.

Dependencies
------------

python-openid (Ubuntu package)

Configuration
-------------

Make the icons directory accessible as /media/icons/sm (i.e. social media).

In settings.py, add 'emailverification' and 'registration' to your INSTALLED_APPS.

Then set:

    APP_NICE_SHORT_NAME = "MySite" # a short name for your site
    SERVER_EMAIL = "MySite <noreply@example.org>" # From: address on verification emails
    REGISTRATION_ASK_USERNAME = True
    
If REGISTRATION_ASK_USERNAME is True, then the user is always asked for
a username. If False, a username is guessed when enough information is
provided by the login provider.
		
Optionally set:

    SITE_ROOT_URL = "http://www.example.org" # canonical base URL of the site, no trailing slash
                                             # The default will be "http://%s" % Site.objects.get_current().domain
		
Add records to your URLConf like this (you can use any base path):

    (r'^emailverif/', include('emailverification.urls')),
    (r'^registration/', include('registration.urls')),

You will probably also want to use:

    (r'^accounts/login$', 'registration.views.loginform'),
    (r'^accounts/logout$', 'django.contrib.auth.views.logout'),
    (r'^accounts/profile/change_password$', 'django.contrib.auth.views.password_change'),
    (r'^accounts/profile/password_changed$', 'django.contrib.auth.views.password_change_done'),

You will probably want to override the templates in

    emailverification/templates/emailverification
        badcode.html: invalid verification code or an error occurred processing it
        expired.htm: expired verification code

by either editing them in place or copying the directories to your site's
root templates directory and editing the copies there. 

Run python manage.py syncdb to create the necessary database tables.
